**Abstract:** This document establishes that distance, as measured in 4D (e.g., light-years), is an illusion of malleable space-time, unreliable due to relativity's reference-dependence. Light-years (d = c t) inherit time's malleability, where t dilates with gravity/speed. In my theorem, distance derives from 5D phase twists: $$d = \frac{2\pi R}{\sin(\theta_y)}$$, with phase $$\theta_y$$ transposing uniform 5D to 4D "stretch." Mathematical derivations and graphical representations illustrate these implications.

## Reasoning and Thought Experiment

Current physics treats light-years as reliable, assuming constant c in flat space-time. I challenge this by proposing the contrary: Light-years fail because time t is reference-dependent in malleable space-time, making distance illusory. To defy this, consider the thought experiment of lightspeed travel: At c, distance collapses to a "dot" (time stops), rendering light-years meaningless—challenging their reliability as time-space hybrids. The theorem resolves this with phase-based metrics, deriving true distance from 5D twists.

## Derivation of Light-Year Unreliability

The light-year relies on the time component t, malleable in 4D space-time. The theorem derives time as uniform in 5D (constant dt_{5D}), with 4D relativity as phase bias: $$dt_{4D} = dt_{5D} / \sin(\theta_y)$$. Light-years (distance = c t_{4D}) inherit this illusion, unreliable as t is reference-dependent.

- **Mathematical Derivation**: For photons, constant phase $$\sin(\theta_y) = 1$$ derives zero 5D time passage, while 4D sees dilation. Light-year d = c t_{4D} projects as a "dot" at c, deriving unreliability—true distance from phase: $$d = \frac{2\pi R}{\sin(\theta_y)}$$.

Graphically, phase vs. derived distance (as $$\sin(\theta_y)$$ decreases, d "stretches" to infinity):

(Distance scales inversely with phase, deriving light-years as phase-modulated illusions.)

## Conclusion

These derivations from the 5D theorem establish light-years as unreliable 4D artifacts, providing a unified resolution to metric paradoxes.

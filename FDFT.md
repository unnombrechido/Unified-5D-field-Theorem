A Unified 5D Field Theorem: Elemental Particles as Manifestations of Higher-Dimensional Equilibria
Author: Omar Puente Date: January 11, 2026 Affiliation: Independent Researcher, Keller, Texas, US Abstract: I propose a radical reinterpretation of fundamental physics, assuming that elemental particles—particularly their mass—do not exist as intrinsic entities but emerge as 4D projections or “bubbles” from a unified 5D electron field. Mass, gravity, and subatomic interactions are illusions arising from field equilibria and reconfigurations in higher dimensions. This theorem challenges the Standard Model’s quark-based structure, Bell’s non-locality implications, and General Relativity’s treatment of singularities, offering a local 5D resolution to apparent paradoxes. Observations interpreted as supporting quarks or non-locality are misinterpretations of 4D shadows; I challenge them by deriving consistent predictions from the 5D framework. Mathematical derivations, graphical representations, philosophical underpinnings, and proposed experiments (both viable and thought-based) are provided to validate the theorem.
Introduction
The prevailing paradigms of physics—the Standard Model (SM) for particles and General Relativity (GR) for gravity—rely on assumptions that lead to unresolved paradoxes: Why do particles appear to have mass? What underlies apparent non-locality in quantum entanglement? How do singularities arise, and can they be resolved without ad-hoc mechanisms? I assert that these stem from a fundamental misperception: Elemental particles do not exist as discrete, massive objects. Instead, they are 4D manifestations of a unified 5D electron field, where “mass” is emergent bound energy, gravity a side effect of field gradients, and interactions projections from higher-dimensional equilibria.
Philosophically, this echoes the Biblical notion that “what can be seen comes from what cannot be seen” (Hebrews 11:3), interpreting visible particles as shadows of unseen 5D entities. Mathematically, it builds on nonlinear field equations with compact extra dimensions. The theorem’s strengths lie in unification (one field explains all) and resolving paradoxes (e.g., non-locality as 5D locality). Observations seemingly supporting quarks or non-locality are wrong interpretations of 4D projections; I challenge them by showing how the 5D framework derives the same data more elegantly, without invoking unnecessary entities.
Core Assumptions and Definitions
	1	The Unified Electron Field: All phenomena stem from a single scalar field (\Phi(x^\mu, y)) in 5D spacetime, where (x^\mu) are 4D coordinates and (y) is compactified (circle of radius (R)). This field replaces quarks, leptons, and bosons.
	2	Particles as Bubbles: Protons/neutrons are soliton-like disturbances (bubbles) in (\Phi), with an “event horizon” membrane (boundary where field gradients manifest properties) and empty interior. Mass is illusory—bound field energy (E = \int [\frac{1}{2}(\nabla\Phi)^2 + V(\Phi)] d^4x).
	3	5D Manifestations: 4D observations (e.g., decays, jets) are projections: (\phi(x^\mu) = \int dy , e^{i k y / R} \Phi(x^\mu, y)), where (k) modes create particle “flavors.” What appears as quarks or jets are misinterpretations of these projections; I challenge quark evidence by showing field fragments produce similar scattering patterns.
	4	Gravity and Mass as Side Effects: Gravity emerges from 5D phase twists: (G_{\text{effect}} = \frac{\phi}{R} \cdot \sin(\theta_y)), where (\theta_y) is the transposed angle. No fundamental G—it’s derived from 5D geometry, challenging GR’s curvature as a 4D illusion.
Mathematical Representation
The 5D action is: [ S = \int d^4x , dy \left[ \frac{1}{2} \partial_M \Phi \partial^M \Phi - V(\Phi) \right] ] with (V(\Phi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \Phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda \Phi^4 + \frac{\alpha}{r^2} \Phi^2) (radial dependence for Z-level scaling, challenging atomic spectra as 4D projections).
Equation of motion: [ \square_5 \Phi + \frac{dV}{d\Phi} = 0 ]
	•	Bubble Solutions: Static solitons: (\Phi(y) = \sqrt{\frac{2m^2}{\lambda}} \tanh\left( \frac{m y}{\sqrt{2}} \right)), projecting to 4D particles. Shadow size (S = \sqrt{R^2 - \phi^2} \cdot \lambda), stable for (R > \phi). This challenges proton mass measurements as field energy, not quark sums.
	•	Decay Dynamics: Perturbation (\gamma \Phi) causes reconfiguration: Simulated as field spreading, predicting lifetime (\tau \approx 1/\gamma) (matching 880 s for neutrons via 5D tuning). Challenges weak force as misinterpreted field instability.
	•	Gravity Generation: Metric induction: (g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}(\Phi)), with (h_{\mu\nu} \propto \partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi / M_{Pl}^2), where phase (\phi) transposes as (\sin(\theta_y)). Challenges GR singularities as 4D artifacts of finite 5D equilibria.
Graphically, 5D singularity resolution (finite density projection):  (4D density vs. position: Finite peak, challenging infinite curvature as projection error.)
Philosophically, this theorem asserts that “what can be seen” (particles, gravity) emerges from “what cannot be seen” (5D entities), challenging materialist interpretations by positing higher-dimensional reality as the true foundation.
Challenges to Standard Interpretations
The theorem assumes correctness, viewing conflicting observations as wrong interpretations of 4D projections. I challenge key data points:
	•	Quark Jets and Scattering: SM interprets collider jets as quark hadronization, but this is a misinterpretation of field fragments in 5D cascades. My model derives similar sprays from nonlinear terms in (\lambda \Phi^3), without quarks—challenging SLAC/LHC data as 4D shadows, predicting no point-like substructure in ultra-high-energy tests.
	•	Neutron Decay Rates: SM attributes fixed lifetimes to weak force, but this misinterprets field reconfigurations. My perturbation (\gamma \Phi) derives the 880 s rate from 5D phase imbalances, challenging isolation experiments (e.g., UCN traps) as overlooking dimensional leakage—predicts subtle variations in extreme vacuums.
	•	Entanglement Non-Locality: Bell’s violations are misinterpreted as FTL; in my model, they’re 5D local bridges (equation (\partial_y^2 \Phi) shortcuts). Challenges Aspect experiments as 4D projections, predicting phase-dependent correlations in curved space (e.g., near black holes).
	•	Singularities and Gravity: GR’s infinities are misinterpretations of finite 5D equilibria. My metric (g_{\mu\nu}) resolves them via y-integration, challenging LIGO waves as 4D echoes—predicts gravity anomalies in mergers from phase twists.
Suggested Viable Experiments
	•	Field-Dependent Decay Probes: Measure neutron lifetimes in varying 5D-simulated fields (e.g., ultra-high magnetic gradients mimicking phase twists). Theorem predicts twist-induced variations; challenges SM constancy. (Viable: Extend LANL UCNτ with tunable solenoids.)
	•	Dimensional Leakage in Colliders: Search for 5D mode signatures (KK particles) in LHC upgrades (2027+). Theorem predicts extra resonances from y-modes; challenges SM null results as misidentified field fragments. (Viable: Analyze high-luminosity data for anomalous jets.)
	•	Gravity Phase Tests: Probe gravity-entanglement links in quantum sensors near massive objects (e.g., neutron interferometry on ISS). Theorem predicts phase twists altering Bell correlations; challenges GR/QM separation.
Thought Experiments
	•	Sun Disappearance in 5D: If the sun reconfigures (bursts), gravity delay is 5D propagation—predicts correlated light/gravity echoes, challenging GR’s c-limit as 4D illusion.
	•	Entangled Bubbles in Isolation: Two entangled bubbles measured across distance—predicts no FTL, just 5D local twist; challenges Bell as 4D misinterpretation.
This theorem, by assuming particle non-existence, unifies physics under 5D fields, challenging standard interpretations as limited 4D views. Future work will derive more predictions from the equations.
